NAME
    Catalyst::View::TT - Template View Class

SYNOPSIS
        # use the helper
        create.pl view TT TT

        # lib/MyApp/View/TT.pm
        package MyApp::View::TT;

        use base 'Catalyst::View::TT';

        __PACKAGE__->config->{DEBUG} = 'all';

        1;
    
        $c->forward('MyApp::View::TT');

DESCRIPTION
    This is the "Template" view class. Your subclass should inherit from
    this class. If you want to override TT config settings, you can do it
    there by setting __PACKAGE__->config->{OPTION} as shown in the synopsis.
    Of interest might be EVAL_PERL, which is disabled by default, and
    LOAD_TEMPLATES, which is set to use the provider.

    If you want to use EVAL perl, add something like this:

        __PACKAGE__->config->{EVAL_PERL} = 1;
        __PACKAGE__->config->{LOAD_TEMPLATES} = undef;

  METHODS
   process
    Renders the template specified in $c->stash->{template} or
    $c->request->match to $c->response->output.

   config
    This allows your view subclass to pass additional settings to the TT
    config hash.

SEE ALSO
